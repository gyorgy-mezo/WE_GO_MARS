# LLM Knowledge-Gathering Question Tree for Mars Radiation Shielding

This tree organizes prompts for interrogating language models about Mars mission radiation shielding. Upper levels target broad reasoning suitable for large models; leaves are phrased as focused questions that small or domain-tuned models can answer reliably. Use the hierarchy to scaffold research sessions or automated knowledge harvesting pipelines.

## Tagging Scheme
- **Priority (Px):** P0 = foundational and mission-critical; P1 = high value; P2 = medium; P3 = supplementary.
- **Model Size (Mx):** ML = large model (≥30B) recommended; MM = mid-size (10–30B); MS = small model (≤10B) viable.
- Unless noted otherwise, deepest leaf nodes are tagged `[P1|MS]` by default—suitable for small models to retrieve specific facts.
- The tables below highlight priority focus areas for each branch; adapt tags as knowledge gaps emerge.

## Usage Notes
- **Top-down exploration:** Start at level 0–2 with a large model to generate context and identify gaps, then branch into level 3–6 for targeted follow-up.
- **Small-model deployment:** Assign leaf questions to compact models (e.g., 7B–13B parameter LLMs) for quick fact retrieval, supplier profiling, or requirement elaboration.
- **Integration:** Map responses back to the repository’s specifications (e.g., link shielding material answers to `system-spec/DESIGN_APPROACH.md` or supplier info to `SUPPLIERS.md`).
